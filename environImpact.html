			<h2>The Environment</h2>
			<p>The number one concern expressed over the oil industry, is the impact it has on the environment. Starting simply, the oil industry affects the environment through its heavy use of vehicle transport. The gas emissions produced while cleaning oil products, the destruction of land to make room for large rigs, and of course, the occasional oil spill are all culprits of negative environmental impact.</p>

		<div id="info2">
			<h2>Marine Life Specifically</h2>
			<p>In 2010, the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, proved that environmentalists concerns are valid, and there concerns could very quickly turn into a real life nightmare. The issue was not only the initial explosion. It also released clouds of oil into the ocean, killing hundreds of marine lives, as well taking human lives. It continued to expand as all of the containment methods failed for one reason or another. This memory lives on, and gives fear to many, that regardless of years of research, not all spills are easily cleaned, or contained</p>
			<h2>Environment vs. Economy</h2>
			<p>So if it is conclusively bad for the environment, why is drilling, and oil consumption still a part of day to day life? Often when articles examine the impact the oil industry has on the environment, it is battled by the positive impact the oil industry has on the economy. One of the reasons that oil has become as controversial an issue as it is, is due to the economic dependence on the product, versus the environmental damage done through its mining.</p>
