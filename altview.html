			<h2>Pro-Oil</h2>
			<p>There are many different groups of people who support the Oil Industry in Alberta. The supporters of the oil industry are looking at the industry from an economical point of view. These are groups such as Oil and Gas companies, families of people working in oil and gas, and people who understand how much revenue the industry produces for the province, and in turn the country. These supporters would argue that Albertas entire way of life is currently based around the industry, and it would be too difficult to change rapidly. They believe that it is the only found resource yet, that is able to accomplish what Alertans have all come to accept as everyday life. Things like driving your car the distance you do. Heating houses, using plastic, and our relatively low tax rates.</p>

			<h2>Anti-Oil</h2>
			<p>For nearly every project the oil industry embarks upon, there are groups of people who protest. Recently, in Lethbridge Alberta, there was an anti-fracking group with a mass campaign to keep fracking from coming to the west end of the city. This campaign involved the news media, using a giant logo that supporters could place on shops, and on their houses, the signing of petitions, and the creation of a base <a href"http://www.nodrillinglethbridge.ca/" target="_blank">website.</a> Their parties platform included concerns about the noise that would be caused by the rig, and added transport to and from the rig. They were worried about water polution, which has been found in a couple major fracking sites, they were concerned it would no longer allow for the expansion of the west side, and they were worried that it might smell. This is one good example of many of the arguments against the oil projects popping up over Alberta.</p>
			<p>There are alternative means of energy which have been discovered. Means such as; water energy, using the movement of the water to turn engines that using resistance, create power. Wind Energy, using giant wind turbines that are turned by the force of the wind and using resistance, create power. Solar energy, where solar panels gather the energy from the sun, and many people believe their are other alternative means of energy being held by the government. Unfortunately, all of these sources also have their own drawbacks. Not all places have enough moving water, or enough wind blowing to power the entire city. Solar panel would likely be the best option, however the manufacturing of the <a href="http://www.altenergymag.com/content.php?post_type=1412" target="_blank">solar panels </a>is still done with drilled oil. It is also very expensive, and would be a very difficult transition to afford.</p>
