			<h2>Funding Canada</h2>
			<p>According to a <a href="http://www.finance.alberta.ca/publications/fiscal/spotlights/2012-0223-alberta-net-contribution-to-confederation.pdf">Canadian Financial Report</a>, Alberta is the only province who is continuously making money for the country, as opposed to furthering the debt. It is common knowledge that Alberta's economy is 'run off of' the oil industry. In 2009, Alberta contributed $15 993 million in Equalization payments to Canada, while each other province and territory was at least - $11 000 000 further in debt. With such high numbers it can be easily deduced how this could become such a hot topic. If we try to stop the oil industry, there is a great chance that the new means of income will not make nearly as much, and only contribute to Canada's deficit.</p>

			<h2>Creating Jobs</h2>
			<p>Aside from being a natural good for sale, and earning money from oil and gas that way, the oil industry has also created an immense number of work opportunities for people. There are entire cities in Alberta whose growth patterns support the statement, that the town would not be as 'booming' were it not for the present oil industy. Towns such as Grande Prairie, and Fort McMurray are notorious oil towns. Because of the number of men attracted to the oil lifestyle, there are families who would move to cities they would not regularily. The influx of families creates a need for more food, clothing, and other amenities. This in turn, creates jobs at these new opening places, trying to keep up with the town growth.</p>
			<h2>Revenue</h2>
			<p>So it makes money, but what does this money do to help out people, and is it worth the environmental cost? Alberta sees about <a href="http://www.finance.alberta.ca/publications/fiscal/spotlights/2012-0223-alberta-net-contribution-to-confederation.pdf">52%</a> of the money created by Albertans, back in the form of Federal Services. These services range anywhere from Health Care, to education. For some, this knowledge is enough to ignore the environmental cost, as many people enjoy the current lifestyle made available by the profit off the oil industry. </p>
