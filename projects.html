				<h2>Energy East Pipeline</h2>
				<p>Expected to transport over 1.1 Billion barrels of oil a day, this 4600km pipeline will transport oil from Alberta and Saskatchewan, all the way to the Eastern end of Canada. With construction plotted to begin in 2017, there are thousands of jobs predicted as outcome of the massive projects. In Alberta alone, the numbers reach as far as 1200 new jobs in Alberta, both directly and indirectly. By the year 2040 the pipeline is expected to have made Canada over $55 Billion dollars in revenue, which will then go towards priveledges such as education, and healthcare. </p>
				<p>Transcanada has promised that they have put their best foot forward on the safety side of the construction. The pipe is to be monitered via satellite 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Each section of pipe is being specifically designed to suit the studied area of land it will call home. Bodies of water are where the majority of saftey studies have been performed. There are plans to have shut off valves on either side, as well as thicker walled, safer pipes laid.

				<h2>Oil Sands</h2>
				<p>Covering over 142 000 square kilometers of Albertan 
		land, the oil sands are the third largest reserve of bitumen in the world. The oil 
		sands are compiled from a mixture of sand, water, clay, and bitumen. Bitumen is 
		the component the oil industry is working to obtain. It is an extremely thick 
		substance which requires the proper heat, and dilution to reach a workable 
		viscosity. In order to remove, and refine the bitumen, Dr. Karl A. Clark has 
		researched a hot-water extraction method that fairly easily obtains this goal.</p>
